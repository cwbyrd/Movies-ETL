# Movies-ETL
## This module/challenge centered around the application of the Extract/Transform/Load process. We pull in data from Kaggle (ratings and movie data), as well as from Wikipedia. Once we have taking both sets and merged them into a single data set, we load them into an SQL database where the data can be further processed. The result was a successful load with clean data from both sources. As I took the 90% rule when removing columns with greater than 90% null values as opposed to 100, my number was 6077 vs 6052. Now we are ready to process data in the pgAdmin SQL database.
